# Simple Todos Application

> A simple **Todo's** Application created using React.js.

> #### Key Features
>
> - Included a text input field and an Add button at the top of the todo list.
> - When editing the title of a todo, placed an Edit button next to each todo item. This button changes to a Save button when clicked.
> - Saves the updated title, on clicked the Save button, the button then changes back to an Edit button.
> - To mark tasks as complete, added a checkbox at the beginning of each todo item. This checkbox, when checked, strikes out the corresponding todo item.
> - Implemented a functionality to add multiple todos with the same title at once, by entering the title and number of todos, separated by a space, in the input field.
> - Application maintains good CSS styling and responsiveness.
